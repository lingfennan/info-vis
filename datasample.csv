The migrants to Palestine in thsi wave cherished the ideals of ""conquest of land"" and ""conquest of labour"", which were the early forms of Labor Zionism. The migrants in this wave established many early kibbutzim and moshavim (Jewish agrarian settlements). It was during this wave that David Ben-Gurion emigrated, and went on to be a prominent leader of Zionists, and the first Prime Minister of Israel.

The widespread land acquisitions by Zionists were had started pushing Arab peasants of Palestine out of their land. The repeated thwarting of Arab political ambitions was also testing the patience of the Arabic leadership. There was a constant fear that the Zionist Jews will take over control of the Western Wall in Jerusalam (a Jewish prayer place), which was considered to be a part of the holy Al-Aqsa mosque, thus a holy place for both the communities. Since the Muslim Arabs viewed any changes to the Wall by the Jews as designs to take over the Wall, they prohibited any construction at the wall. However in September of 1928, Jews erected some screens and chairs for their festival of Yom Kippur. This was met with outrage, and the Arabs set up a variety of designs that made it inconvenient for the Jews to conduct prayer at the site. This sparted protests from the Jewish community. Tensions escalated over time, and precipitated in the form of sectarian violence in the August of 1929. Riots broke out in Jerusalem, the news of which quickly spread to other cities, which incited similar antisemetic violence in Jaffa, Hebron and Safad. In all, 133 Jews and 116 Arabs were left dead at the end of the spate of violence. In the episode, the Haganah had tried to defend the Jews in the cities. The experience of these riots reshaped their direction, and they transformed themselves an untrained militia to a capable underground army quickly. Another aftermath of this episode was the Shaw Commission, which was tasked with conducting inquiries into the causes of the violence.

The report concluded that the Palestinian indiginious population was antagonistic towards Zionists and their designs in Palestine. They perceived the Zionist immigrants as a threat to their people, and that the root of the violence lied in the Arab national desire to be independent of their influence in the political sphere. The report suggested, as a solution, partitioning palestine into a 20% Jewish state, and remaining Arab state based on the current Jewish population and land ownership. However, HAC outright rejected it, and demanded for a full Arab state and withdrawal of the Balfour declaration. Jewish Yishuv agreed to the petition but with minor resistance about the land allocated to them.

British attempted to quell the rebels using heavy force and reinforcements from Egypt and England. The AHC and the National Committees were disbanded, and mass arrests ensued. The Haganah cooperated with the British closely to counter the violence, which gave the Haganah a lot of on-the-field experience. By the end of the violence, an estimated 5000 Arabs, 300 Jews and 262 Britons were killed. This was a national struggle of the palestinian people, and was the movement that crystallized palestinian nationalism into a single identity, and a single unified movement. The brutality of British methods to quell the rebellion painted them in a very negative light, and caused the Arab population to even strongly desire independence from them. However the uprising also cost the Palestinians dearly. By the end of the violence, the Palestinian Arab military might was greatly weakened, and left a large portions of the countryside in ruins, increased the unemployment rate among Palestinians and caused the best and brightest of their lot to emigrate to escape the fighting. Most Palestinian leaders had either been arrested, or exiled by the end of the revolt. The large scale revolt, however, inflicted damages to the British side which made them re-think the profitability of being in control of Palestine when the Arab sentiment was not in their favour.

During the proceedings, the Arab leaders refused to meet together with Zionist ones, and separate meetings with convened with both. The Arabs demanded and end to Jewish immigration, no ""Jewish National Home"" in Palestine and independence from the Mandate.

Arabs refused to accecpt the legitimacy of the paper, and so did the Zionists.

93,Rise of Nazi Power in post WW1 Germany,,,,,1932,,,,"At the end of WW1, Jews in Germany were the most assimiliated in society compared to any other European country. The social tensions in Germany after the war led to a socialist revolution, which forced the Kaiser monarchy to abdicate, and left Germany in the hands of a new Weimar Republic government run by Social democrats. During their rule, the country faced many economic hardships which caused it to lose face. The Nazi party opposed the government due to their communist affinities. Apart from the Nazis, many other groups criticized  the economic consequences of the Social Democrats. Hitler's Nazi Party slowly came to power and eventually overcame the ruling party. Adolf Hitler became the Chancellor in 1933, and consolidated power as a dictator by 1934. In Nazi Germany, Hitler embraced racial antisemetism on a large scale. He spread social Darwinistic propaganda, claiming that the Jews were an inferior race that must be erased. He also strengthened the ""stab in the back"" myth, which alleges that the Jews were responsible for Germany's defeat in WW1 (a subject which was still very emotionally charged for the German people). This was unlike the cultural antisemetism that rest of Europe had witnessed. This was a racially charged motive, and Hitler used his power during the Second World War to bring a ""Final Solution"" the Jewish question using by means of a holocaust.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_myth,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism#Nazi_Germany,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_World_War_I#Germany,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement
85,"WW2, and its influence on Palestine",World War 2,,,,1939-08-01,,,,"The war period was relatively quiet in Palestine, and actually was a time of economic growth. The Jewish immigration had dropped off, which reduced imminent tensions. Most palestinian leaders had been exiled or arrested after the Great Revolt. Many Jewish volunteers joined the British army's Jewish Brigade, which was deployed during the war in various campaigns. Meanwhile, factory production grew by 200% for Jewish owned factories, and 77% for Arab owned factories. The overall acricultural production grew by 30%, and the increase in prices of food products (due to unrestricted submarine warfare in the mediterranean se which restricted imports) increased both volume and revenue for local producers. The stationing of British troops in Palestine only increased the demand for food items. All these circumstances, for once, enabled Palestinian peasants to pull themselves out of debt. This period came to be known as ""The Prosperity"" by Palestinians later.","Gelvin, J. (2005) The Israel-Palestine Conflict - One Hundred Years of War p120",,,,,
