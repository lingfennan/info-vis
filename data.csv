The widespread land acquisitions by Zionists were had started pushing Arab peasants of Palestine out of their land. The repeated thwarting of Arab political ambitions was also testing the patience of the Arabic leadership. There was a constant fear that the Zionist Jews will take over control of the Western Wall in Jerusalam (a Jewish prayer place), which was considered to be a part of the holy Al-Aqsa mosque, thus a holy place for both the communities. Since the Muslim Arabs viewed any changes to the Wall by the Jews as designs to take over the Wall, they prohibited any construction at the wall. However in September of 1928, Jews erected some screens and chairs for their festival of Yom Kippur. This was met with outrage, and the Arabs set up a variety of designs that made it inconvenient for the Jews to conduct prayer at the site. This sparted protests from the Jewish community. Tensions escalated over time, and precipitated in the form of sectarian violence in the August of 1929. Riots broke out in Jerusalem, the news of which quickly spread to other cities, which incited similar antisemetic violence in Jaffa, Hebron and Safad. In all, 133 Jews and 116 Arabs were left dead at the end of the spate of violence. In the episode, the Haganah had tried to defend the Jews in the cities. The experience of these riots reshaped their direction, and they transformed themselves an untrained militia to a capable underground army quickly. Another aftermath of this episode was the Shaw Commission, which was tasked with conducting inquiries into the causes of the violence.

During their rule, the country faced many economic hardships which caused it to lose face. The Nazi party opposed the government due to their communist affinities. Apart from the Nazis, many other groups criticized  the economic consequences of the Social Democrats. Hitler's Nazi Party slowly came to power and eventually overcame the ruling party. Adolf Hitler became the Chancellor in 1933, and consolidated power as a dictator by 1934. In Nazi Germany, Hitler embraced racial antisemetism on a large scale. He spread social Darwinistic propaganda, claiming that the Jews were an inferior race that must be erased. He also strengthened the ""stab in the back"" myth, which alleges that the Jews were responsible for Germany's defeat in WW1 (a subject which was still very emotionally charged for the German people). This was unlike the cultural antisemetism that rest of Europe had witnessed.

Meanwhile, factory production grew by 200% for Jewish owned factories, and 77% for Arab owned factories. The overall acricultural production grew by 30%, and the increase in prices of food products (due to unrestricted submarine warfare in the mediterranean se which restricted imports) increased both volume and revenue for local producers.

Their forces, the Arab Legion, was often working in concert with the British forces. Also, he had his own long-standing aspirations of uniting Jordan, and Greater Syria (Syria and Palestine) into a single Arab dominion. Even before the Great Revolt of 1939, the King had been meeting with Zionist leaders and had good relations with them. Given this history, the King now gave Golda Meir to understand that he would respect the boundaries demarcated by the UN resolution, and would not attack the Jewish forces.

While the exact numbers are still a matter of dispute, an estimated 700,000 Palestinian Arabs fled the country - 80% of the total Arab population of the country. While many Arabs fled simply in the panic of civil war, there is evidence of systematic depopulation of Arab villages by the Haganah (later, the IDF) during the war. Massacres like the Deir Yassin massacre escalated the terror even more, leading to a quicker exodus. Some historians describe it as an occurrence of ""ethnic cleansing"" of the reagion, while other use a more mild term ""transfer ideology"" to describe it. Yet other dispute the fact that the drastic change in demographics of the land was ever a conscious decision, and that the Arabs simply fled by their own voilition. While it is true that the Haganah forcibly evacuated a very large number of Palestinian villages, the intent of this is hard to determine.","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_exodus, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arab_towns_and_villages_depopulated_during_the_1948_Palestinian_exodus"
